# Ice Video Game Overview:
Welcome to the Video Game Success Prediction project for Ice, an online store that sells video games worldwide. This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing user and expert reviews, genres, platforms, and historical sales data to identify patterns that can predict whether a video game will succeed. The project aims to assist in identifying potential blockbuster games and optimizing advertising campaigns for Ice.

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can determine whether a video game will succeed based on various features, including user reviews, expert reviews, genres, platforms, and historical sales data.
